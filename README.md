## About the Two Cleaning Scripts

Two versions of the cleaning script are provided so you can compare coding styles:

- **dplyr version** – Uses the `tidyverse` style of coding. This style is modern, readable, and widely used in data science.

- **base R version** – Uses only built-in R functions. This version is helpful for understanding R’s foundations and does not require any additional packages.

Both versions perform the same tasks.
If you are completely new to R, start with the **base R version** (it’s simpler to run and doesn’t require installing extra packages).
