## About the Two Cleaning Scripts

Two versions of the cleaning script are provided so you can compare coding styles:

- **dplyr version** – Uses the `tidyverse` style of coding. This style is modern, readable, and widely used in data science.

- **base R version** – Uses only built-in R functions. This version is helpful for understanding R’s foundations and does not require any additional packages.

Both versions perform the same tasks.
